### Materials
[Competitive analysis (online algorithm)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_analysis_(online_algorithm))
> As in competitive analysis there is no assumptions on the stochastic modeling of future input, the online algorithm tries
to compete against an adversarial input. Hence, the competitive algorithm might be conservative and not always can provide
satisfactory results in practical scenarios. On the other hand, stochastic optimization approaches rely on the distribution of
the input sequence. However, learning the potentially timevarying distribution in real inputs can be a formidable task.
